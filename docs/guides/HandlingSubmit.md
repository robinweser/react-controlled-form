# Handling Submit

Once our form has been filled out completely, we most likely want to perform some data processing as soon as it gets submitted. A common use case is to send the data to a backend which then e.g. creates an account from the provided user data.

## Example
```javascript
import { Form } from 'react-controlled-form'

function onSubmit({ data }) {
  fetch('https://api.mybackend.com/user/', {
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
    method: 'POST'
  }).then(res => {
    // do something if the server responds positively
  }).catch(err => {
    // do something if sending data went wrong
  })
}

// Usage
<Form formId='user' render={({ data }) => (
  <form onSubmit={() => onSubmit(data)}>...</form>
)} />
```
